+ Project summary: Team 8 was assigned "Learning Fair Representations" and "Fairness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification". Using the algorithms detailed in the papers, the team analyzed the COMPAS dataset, specifically looking at the subset for Caucasian and African-American recidivation rates. The algorithms were then evaluated on accuracy, calibration, and parity.
